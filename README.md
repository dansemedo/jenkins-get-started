#### What is Jenkins? Why should I care about it?

Jenkins is an OSS software strongly supported by the community and can help you to automate build tasks, his purpose is compile, test, integrate and build the code, helping development teams to have a better idea of the final binary after getting coding together.

Jenkins development started in 2004 with Sun Microsystems creating the Hudson (father of Jenkins) Software Project and since from the beginning it was an OSS project. When Oracle bought Sun, they want to get the copyrights and tradermarks from the Hudson name and began creating a commercial version. The community reacted to this and by voting decision they chose Jenkins to be the "fork" name of the project.
